This is the official Indianapolis beerjs group! 
This group is for anyone interested in learning about Javascript - be that Node, React, johnnyfive, or any other awesome Javascript topic. 
We will be hosting many different kinds of talks for all skill levels. 

Indy BeerJS meetings are going to loosely follow the following simple format, but may be multiplied by Math.random().
- 15 minutes of hanging out, meeting new people, etc
- 5 minute introduction to the BeerJS for new members
- 10 minutes of discussion about the next meetings/cool stuff going on/other important notes
- 30 minute talk
- 30 minutes of hanging out and potentially heading out to a nearby bar to grab a beer, talking about the talk, whatever people want to talk about
